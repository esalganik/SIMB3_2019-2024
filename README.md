This dataset contains data from the network of SIMB3 ice mass balance (IMB) buoys deployed between 2019 and 2024. The interfaces of 27 IMB buoys were identified using a combination of temperature data and data from acoustic sounders. The dataset processing was supported by the Research Council of Norway project INTERAAC (grant no. 328957).
